# Weather-API
Weather App using an API

A weather App using https://openweathermap.org/api to get the weather!

Type any city into the search box and get that city's current weather!

Displayed are: City, Date, an icon showing the weather, current temperature, current humidity, wind Speed, and UV index (with color coded bar: green, yellow, orange, red and violet)

In addition to the current weather, also displayed is a five day forecast! Each day of the 5 day forecast displays: Date, an icon showing the weather, temperature humidity!

Type another search into the search bar, and get a new city's weather information!

Want to get back to a city you already searched? Just click on that city's name under the search bar, and you will search that city again, without having to type anythig in!

Special thanks to StackOverflow User: samu101108 who described in detail how to get the open weather api to display the icon to the page!
